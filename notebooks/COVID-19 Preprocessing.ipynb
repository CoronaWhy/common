    "What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability? What do we know about natural history, transmission, and diagnostics for the virus? What have we learned about infection prevention and control?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we need to ask is what we mean by transmission, incubation, and environmental stability -- or, rather, what should a computer understand when we ask this? We can go about encoding this information in several ways: 1) keywords for analysis in some kind of TF-IDF format, probably including a list of synonyms that we would need to develop by hand, 2) high-dimensional vectors vis a vis word2vec or GloVe, or 3) using heavy, but state-of-the-art transformer models for vectorization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords probably aren't going to give us the robust results we're looking for, because typical pre-processing methods remove all sorts of punctuation and numbers, but these are really important in biomedical texts! We could skip the pre-processing except for removing stop words, but we'd still need to address the fact that keywords have synonyms, and we'd need to hand-write these. But there may be an easier way to get better results without all the hassle. \n",
    "\n",
    "I propose method 2: spaCy is a popular NLP package that's blazingly fast and has (mostly) everything we need to process the text. It'll break sentences apart, lemmatize, and even provide vectors for us. Spacy vectors are somewhat simplistic because the vector of several tokens is just the average of the vectors of each token individually -- so we may not get state of the art results. But we'll get them fast, and we'll know if we need to change something up!"

We can break it into pieces later depending on the task we want to use this information for, but querying lines is a lot more useful that querying whole documents when you want to know about something specific like seroconversion, spike proteins, or something else. Once you identify lines of interest, you can generate more data about the actual document, since each line will be indexed with document, start and end character, entities, vectors, and language. \n",
